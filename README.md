My Coding journey

This Program is about Inheritance it have the Animal class as the Parent class and Dog, Husky classes as the Sub-Classess.In the Animal Class there is a feild which have a String variable called name that is not initialised and it is then later initialized in the main method. So i want to inclued a User Input option where the user should input the name and the program executes.
